## Requests

To request a new source or bug fix, [create an issue](https://github.com/yuzono/aniyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

Please note that creating an issue does not mean that the source will be added or fixed in a timely
fashion, because the work is volunteer-based. Some sources may also be impossible to do or prohibitively
difficult to maintain.

If you would like to see a request fulfilled and have the necessary skills to do so, consider contributing!
Issues are up-for-grabs for any developer if there is no assigned user already.
